Palm leaf manuscripts, being historical documents prone to damage, require preservation to prevent further deterioration. Deciphering the handwritten content within these damaged manuscripts is a time-consuming task. In order to understand the handwriting, characters can be extracted and trained using models. In this work, characters have been extracted from the palm leaf manuscripts using connected component analysis and they are manual segregated. A  comparative analysis of deep learning models, including ResNet-50, VGG-16, VGG-19, DenseNet, MobileNet, LeNet-5, and AlexNet has been done. Notably, the DenseNet model achieved a remarkable accuracy of 97.8% in recognizing characters within the palm-leaf Tamil script. This achievement holds promise for effectively understanding the content of these historically significant manuscripts.
